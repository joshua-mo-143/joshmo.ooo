## About Me
Professionally, I'm a DevRel Engineer at [Playgrounds Analytics](https://playgrounds.network), a company that aims to empower AI developers through free open source tooling.

My main programming language of choice is Rust.

As a software developer with expertise in primarily web development, I also have extensive experience using JavaScript, TypeScript and rudimentary experience with most dynamic languages.

Some other languages I like using:
- Clojure
- OCaml

Some random facts about my setup:
- Editor: Zed
- Terminal: Alacritty
- OS: Ubuntu
