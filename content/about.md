## About Me
Professionally, I'm a Junior DevRel Engineer at [Shuttle.rs](https://shuttle.rs), a Rust-native cloud platform.

My main programming language of choice is Rust.

As a software developer with expertise in primarily web development, I also have extensive experience using JavaScript, TypeScript and rudimentary experience with most dynamic languages.

Some other languages I like using:
- Clojure
- OCaml

Some random facts about my setup:
- Editor: Emacs
- Terminal: Alacritty
- OS: Ubuntu

Before I joined Shuttle, I worked in the Chinese wholesale food industry doing sales order entry. I learned Chinese to take sales orders, rudimentary Python and technical writing.

In my spare time, I like hacking and experimenting on new projects. You can check my currently maintained projects [here](/projects).
